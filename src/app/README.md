- Here you place executable of your applications, define what framework used, and initialize application handlers from `src/delivery`
- In this package, you also set up dependency injection for your business requirements. Example:
    - Initialize configurations
    - Initialize database connections for repositories
    - Initialize repositories for services
    - Initialize services for application handlers
    - etc.
- Application implementation can be one of the following, or you can use all of them:
    - REST API (`src/apps/rest`)
    - gRPC API (`src/apps/grpc`)
    - Cron (`src/apps/cron`)
    - Web (`src/apps/web`)
    - etc. (`src/apps/your-app`)
