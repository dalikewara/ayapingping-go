- A **Feature** encapsulates your main business feature, logic, or service
- Here, you include everything necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the feature
- Please prioritize **Feature-Driven Design**, ensuring that features can be easily adapted and seamlessly integrated and imported into different projects
- If another **Feature** imports anything from this location (the current **Feature**), and you want the current **Feature** to be 
accessible through the `importFeature` command without the risk of missing package errors, **DON'T FORGET** to include them in the `dependency.json` file
- The `dependency.json` is **OPTIONAL**, and **ONLY USEFUL WHEN** you use the `importFeature` command. It serves to define
the **Feature** dependencies and avoids possible missing package errors
- A standard **Feature** comprises the following parts: `delivery`, `repositories`, `usecases` and `utility`
  - **delivery**
    - Hosts feature handlers like HTTP handlers, gRPC handlers, cron jobs, or anything serving between the client and your application or feature
    - For config variables, external clients, or use cases, pass or inject them as dependencies
  - **repositories**
    - Handles communication with external data resources like databases, cloud services, or external services
    - Keep your repositories as simple as possible; avoid adding excessive logic
    - If necessary, separate operations into smaller methods
    - Changes outside the `repositories` should not affect them (except changes for business domain/model/entity)
    - For config variables, database frameworks, or external clients, pass or inject them as dependencies
  - **usecases**
    - Contains the main feature logic
    - Changes outside the `usecases` should not impact them (except changes for business domain/model/entity and repositories)
    - For config variables, external clients, or repositories, pass or inject them as dependencies
  - **utility**
    - Accommodates functions tailored to help with common tasks specifically for the **Feature**â€”treat them as helpers
- Feel free to adopt your own style as long as it aligns with the core concept
