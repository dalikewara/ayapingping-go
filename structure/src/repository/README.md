- Repository is a place where you communicate with the real external data resource, like database, cloud service, external service, etc.
- It's always better to keep your repository as simple as possible, don't add too much logic here
- If you have to, you can separate the operations into smaller methods
- You should always call your repository methods inside the use case package
- You may use your `src/library` functions directly in this package
- Any changes outside this package should not affect your repositories (except changes for business entity)
- If you need config variables, database frameworks, or external clients, pass/inject them as dependency
- You can use your own style as long as it doesn't break the main idea
