- Here you place any infrastructure configurations or scripts to help you deploy your project in a server or vm
- It is always **BETTER TO** create folders based on what environment used, example:
    - `infra/dev`, for development
    - `infra/rc`, for release candidate
    - `infra/prod`, for production
    - etc...
